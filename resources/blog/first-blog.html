    So I asked <cite>Bob</cite> about quotations on the 
    Web and he said<q>I know as much about quotations as I do
    about pigeon fancying</q>. Luckily, I found HTML Dog and it said:
    <blockquote cite="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/text/">
    blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used 
    for standalone often multi-line quotations whereas q is used for 
    shorter, in-line quotations.</blockquote>
